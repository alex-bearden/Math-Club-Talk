# Math-Club-Talk
Files from my "The Mathematics of Deep Learning" talk given in the UT Tyler Math Club, 11/16/22

This repository includes:
- [A Python script for scraping article titles off of the Encyclopedia of Mathematics website](https://github.com/alex-bearden/Math-Club-Talk/blob/main/math_encyclopedia_scraper.py)
- [A text file with all the scraped article titles](https://github.com/alex-bearden/Math-Club-Talk/blob/main/math_phrases_final.txt)
- [A Jupyter notebook containing the code for generating new math phrases from the scraped article titles with a recurrent neural network](https://github.com/alex-bearden/Math-Club-Talk/blob/main/math_phrases_language_modeling.ipynb)
- [A text file with some of the generated math phrases](https://github.com/alex-bearden/Math-Club-Talk/blob/main/AI_generated_math_phrases.txt)
- [A Jupyter notebook containing code for all the visualizations in the talk, including from-scratch implementations of gradient descent for linear regression, logistic regression, and a simple neural network](https://github.com/alex-bearden/Math-Club-Talk/blob/main/math_club_talk.ipynb)
